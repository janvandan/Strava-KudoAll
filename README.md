# Strava-KudoAll

Simple java script to give kudos on all new activities on the current Strava web page (https://www.strava.com/dashboard/*)

Must be connectet (log in) to www.strava.com/dashboard (or any www.strava/dashboard/*) before to run the script.

Could be use via an external launcher like Greasemonkey.

Or, simply via the console, same as the "document.querySelectorAll('button.js-add-kudo').forEach(node => node.click());" line.
